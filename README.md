# Validations

This Rails application is built for shippers to help them organize all of the ships in their fleet, with a user login system using Devise. We built this to further our MVC trinity knowledge and better understand ActiveRecord associations. The application allows users to:

Sign up, login and logout

Create new ships that will associate with the userâ€™s profile. Ships have the following attributes:

Name
Amount of containers its able to ship
Location (stored as a string)

Create new jobs. Each job has the following attributes:

Description
Origin (stored as a string)
Destination (stored as a string)
Cost
Amount of containers needed for job
